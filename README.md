### üìú Case Study for "Curriculum Vitae":

#### üîó Website URL: https://faraasat.github.io/curriculum_vitae/
#### üòã GitHub URL: https://github.com/faraasat/curriculum_vitae

#### üíé Client: Personal Project

#### üìå Problem:
As a burgeoning software engineer, I needed a professional platform to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences. My goal was to create a portfolio website that was not only visually appealing but also highly dynamic and responsive, allowing potential employers and collaborators to easily navigate through my professional journey. Additionally, this project was an opportunity to apply and refine my skills in React and Typescript, laying a foundation for more complex future projects.

#### ‚ö° Solution:
I developed a dynamic and colorful portfolio website using React, Typescript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The website was designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. The structure of the site included sections for an introduction, education, languages spoken, projects, contact information, and other relevant details. This comprehensive layout provided a well-rounded view of my professional profile.

#### üöÄ Result:
The portfolio website successfully met its objectives, providing a professional and engaging platform to present my work. It served as a cornerstone for my professional identity online and significantly improved my visibility to potential employers. This initial version has since been deprecated and replaced with version 3, which includes more advanced features and improvements.
